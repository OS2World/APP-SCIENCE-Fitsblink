2.23
Fixed small bug which caused a segmentation fault if the date was not in a one of 
the possible formats. 
2.22
Fixed bug which made the aperture astronomy fail in dense fields.
Added possibility to adjust a parameter for the autolevels function
2.21
Radius of the outer circle for the aperture astrometry can be now up 50.0 pixels
2.2
* Faster display of images (up to 4 times).
* Automating level adjustment set to give brighter images
* Faster star detection (1.5 - 2 times).
* Added aperture astrometry to assure better astrometry of comets.
* Star intensity now displayed in the zoom window.
* Rearranged Options window.
* Default star detection and catalog matching parameters are now read
   from the $HOME/.fitsblinkrc file and configurable from the Settings
   input form.
* Resize of the blinker window is now possible and the new window
*  dimensions can also be stored in $HOME/.fitsblinkrc to be used in next
*  invocation of the program.
* User manual corrected and updated.
* Reading of the object name excluded
2.11
Removed a bug which caused non-detection of stars due to an uninitialized variable.
Corrected spelling error in the Options window.
Removed a bug which caused segmentation fault if an image was loaded from the command line and later another was tried to be loaded.

2.1
Added possibility to update the WCS values in a FITS file.

2.04
Corrected display of declination for values between 0 and -1.
Star detection algorithm does not report the objects which are touching the edge
