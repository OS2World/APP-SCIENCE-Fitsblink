Here are some answers to the randomly selected questions that may
arise in user's heads.


1.  What is the difference between settings in the Options window and
in the Settings window?

The values in the Options window are valid for the currently displayed
image.  If you change them they will be effective only for this image.
The values in the Settings menu are the default parameter values which
are assigned to the set of parameters for the newly loaded images.
Changing the values in the Options window will not affect the values
in the Settings window and vice versa.  However, you can transfer the
values from Settings to Options by pressing the Default button in the
Options window.


2.  I played with parameters in the Settings window and saved them.
Now star matching is no good anymore and I forgot the initial values.
What should I do?

If you really badly mess up the parameter values, you can erase the
.fitsblinkrc file in your home directory and then run fitsblink
again.  Open the Settings window and press Save.  By this you will set
the "default default values".


3. How to avoid mounting GSC CD-ROMs all the time?

Nowadays the hard disks are quite big and you can simply copy the
complete directory structure from the CD-ROM to your hard disk.  You
can save quite some space by compressing the gsc files with the gzip
program.  To do this, go to the gsc/ directory and type

find ./ -name "*.gsc" -exec gzip {} \;
