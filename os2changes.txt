changes to compile fitsblink 2.24 on xfree86-OS/2

changed random() to rand() 'cause I'm lazy and don't want to link 
in bsd.lib which supports random().

commented out:

telescope.c 522:

 /* fl_set_clock_adjustment(state.telescope->telutW, timezone); */

and
telescope.c 307: 
/*  fl_show_object(state.telescope->exponW); */

and
telescope.c 311:
/*fl_hide_object(state.telescope->exponW);*/


don't know why these don't work...!
